My final project is called Rooftop Escape.


The original idea for my final project was a medieval running game where you had to jump over obstacles and take out enemies to make it to the end of the level.
After I spent some more time thinking about it, I changed the project from a medieval setting to a more modern one. I went and found a cityscape background image that 
I liked then I began to set up the level layout. I used gray platforms to make it look like you were on a roof, then used a red rectangle at the end of the level to 
show that it was the finish line.

After I got some sort of basic level layout I decided that I wanted to make my own sprites, then used Aseprite to do so. Once the sprites were complete I implemented them
into the project. (They guy in the blue hoodie is the controlled character, and the guy in the suit is the enemy.) Once this part was done I made a sort of 
techno, cyberpunk style beat for the background music in my game by sequencing 4 notes. 

For the hardware part of this project I decided to make a controller with my breadboard, it included a joystick for movement and a button to jump with.

The game is set up to where you have to move the controlled character to the finish line with the controller (red rectangle) while avoiding falling down and touching the 
guy in the suit.(if you do either of those you lose)

If I were to continue development in the future I would want to set up:
*Multiple levels
*More background music for new levels
*Add some sort of collectable in the levels (like a coin or something)
*Give the enemies a path that they can move on
